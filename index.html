            Hi I'm Will. I was born in Salt Lake City Utah, but currently live in the greater Seattle metro area. I'm 35 years old and have loved programming
            since I was a freshman in high school. I was born into an unusual family and grew up with many brothers and sisters. Like, think of a number and 
            I probably have more siblings than that. I have lived most of my life in the stat of Utah, but I've also had the pleasure of living in wonderful 
            places such as California, Virginia, and of course Washington.
        </p>

            I am the only one of my mothers children to earn their high school diploma, I know it's not much but it's something that is important to me. During 
            high school I attended a concurrent course during my last two years where I learned programming for half of the day at a place called Jordan Applied
            Technology Center. I have attempted college a couple of times but life ultimately overcame my attempts and I did not ever complete my first year.

            I have had a varried number of jobs so far in my life. From my first job to now I have been a pizza delivery guy, a QA tester at a software firm, 
            Then a couple of software developer positions at two different companies. I went through a divorce and my tech career suffered and I jumped around
            working as a fry cook, a chimney sweep helper, I worked in a warehouse for a catering company and shortly became the manager. Then I worked at a 
            window factory loading up trucks to be delivered all over the country, then moved across the state to make the last leg of those window deliveries
            in a box truck to work sites all over the greater seattle metro area. I did a short job at a startup in Bellevue as a full stack dev, that was a 
            tough job, but they ran out of money so I went back to a manual job working on gas meters. Now I'm unemployed working on completing the Codefellows 
            bootcamp!
